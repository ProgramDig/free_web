					Auto insurance is a necessary expense, but that doesn’t mean you should end up paying MORE than you need to!
					Here are 4 easy ways for you to cut your premiums down by a few hundred dollars:
				</p>

				<h2 class="head-p">Drive Safely and Slowly</h2>
				<p>
					Auto insurance can be quite expensive, even for a driver who holds a good record. But if you are someone with a track record of traffic violations and accidents, it can turn out to be even more expensive for you! Driving slower and safer is one of the best ways to get affordable auto insurance premiums.In case you already have violations on your record, be careful and avoid adding to them. Most states drop traffic and driving violations from your record after three years. 
				</p>

				<h2 class="head-p">“Insurance-Friendly” Cars</h2>
				<p>
					The car you drive plays a huge factor in your auto insurance premiums. The next time you purchase a new vehicle, make sure it is auto insurance-friendly. A few rules of thumb to remember is to: avoid overly expensive cars like sports cars, making sure the car comes with solid safety features. The level of safety of your car and its cost can help get lower insurance premiums. Why? These factors make you less liable to insurance claims.
				</p>

				<h2 class="head-p">Make the Most of “behavior-Based” Discounts</h2>
				<p>
					Good drivers help insurance companies make money. For that reason, certain insurance providers offer competitive prices and discounts to drivers with clean driving records, no traffic violations etc.
				</p>

				<h2 class="head-p">Be Sure to Shop Around for Options</h2>
				<p>
					Most vehicle owners tend to stick around and stay with the same auto insurance providers for years on end. While it may be convenient, it isn’t always the best idea. Even though insurance providers do end up giving you loyalty incentives, what you don’t realize is that you also keep increasing your insurance rates over the years.
					To avoid getting stuck in this rut, you should ideally check and compare the auto insurance rates being offered in the market by other insurance providers every two years.
					This can work out well for you because insurance companies usually offer heavy discounts to bring in new customers. These discounts and offers can turn out to be cheaper than what you are paying your current insurance provider.
