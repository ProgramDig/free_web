					If you’ve decided to buy a car, there are many options available in the market for you to choose from! Over the years, more and more drivers have started gravitating towards SUVs and Sedans and rightly so! The latest advancements in these segments have added to the on-going debate of SUVs v/s Sedans.
					To help you narrow down your choice, we have listed the top 3 advantages both sedans and SUVs bring to the table:
				</p>

				<h2 class="head-p">Why Choose an SUV</h2>
				<p>
					– SUV typically offer a lot more space: As is obvious from their shape and build, SUVs offer a lot more space compared to other cars, making them the perfect fit for anyone who transports a lot of stuff, likes to take long road trips or carries a lot of equipment.

					– They can accommodate more people: If you have a big family or are planning on heading on a road trip with a big group, the SUV’s spacious cabins are made for you! They can easily fit around 6 people.
					
					– SUVs offer better handling off roads: The majority of SUV models in the market come with a four-wheel-drive variant, offering them more than enough power and handling capabilities to handle steep roads and rough terrains. They are also equipped with traction control systems that help you maneuver and conquer off-roading adventures.				</p>

				<h2 class="head-p">Why Choose a Sedan</h2>
				<p>
					– Sedans offer a ton of convenient features: The latest sedans that have entered the market come equipped with a lot of convenience features that would’ve never crossed your mind! You can now connect your sedans to Apple or Android smartwatches and start the car’s engine remotely and so many other things.

					– Safety is a priority when it comes to Sedans: Sedan manufacturers have always loaded up their cars with the latest and more advanced safety features like anti-lock braking systems, functional airbags, electronic traction control and more. Apart from these, they also offer numerous other driver assistance features like forward automatic braking, parking assistance, rear vision cameras, front pedestrian braking, lane keep assist and more! All of these top-of-the-notch features work together to give the safest and smoothest driving experience.
					
					– Sedans have excellent fuel economy: Compared to an SUV’s bulky body that guzzles down fuel, Sedans offer way better fuel economy ratings, especially when they’re cruising.				</p>
